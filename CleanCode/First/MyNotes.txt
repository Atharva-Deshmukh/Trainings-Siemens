Design patterns

					VS CODE shortcuts: 

(ctrl + ~)  -> terminal laao and remove
(ctrl + B)  -> side bar laao and remove
(ctrl + K + W)  -> Closes all files in VS Codes
(ctrl + P)  -> File search [SAVES TIME IN LARGE PROJECTS]
(ctrl + L)  -> clears terminal
(ctrl + tab)  -> changes tab and holding it gives dropdown list of tabs

(fn + f2)  -> changes variables names everywhere. highlight variable firstS

					NOTES C#

Naming pattern for functions():
    >>PascalCase use hoga [TotalValue]  used for: functions,variables, class name, variables(non-private)
        also
        camelCase -> [firstDecondThirdFourth...] userd for: Private data member of a class
        snake_casing -> [atharva_deshmukh]
        kebab-casing -> [atharva-deshmukh]

    >>never write any fun() without giving a comment or gist above that tells what it does

>>C# is 
    statically & strongly typed and  compiled language 
    supports all Programming paradigms
    java ki tarah bytecode(its an intermediary code) bnata hai

>> Programming paradigms:
    structural/procedural
    Object oriented
    Functional Programming 


>> Identation
    jaha jaha blocks khatam hore vaha spaces diya karo
    operators and operands me space hona chaiye

>> There should be ONLY ONE layer of abstraction in the code
    one Level of abstraction: One function has one purpose only

>> Technical debt
